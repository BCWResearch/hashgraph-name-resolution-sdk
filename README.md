# hashgraph.name resolution SDK

In **pieFi**'s effort to create a web3 username public good, we'd like to also deliver a public SDK available for use by any entity that wants to resolve hashgraph names to empower their own solutions.

Please feel free to suggest any edits or to reach out for any help or partnerships you could be looking for.
